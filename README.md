# The great heist subtitle heist

A project I worked on to selected a heist movie for a movie review group, with 
the requirement that the movie had to be selected around the randomly choicen
noun "Look." This project outlines the process of how I reached a data informed
decision by the metric of total amound of 'look' used in the script for the movie.

A list of heist movies were gathered from a [Wikipedia page for heist movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heist_film), and subtitles were attempted to be scrapped from two seperate websites.

The movie was picked from the top contenders, and what could be watched by every member of the movie group.

A [video was also clipped together](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM35YuKxtG4) [explicit] of all instances of "look" for entertainment.

## Future plans

I'd like to expand upon this project by setting up proper functions to gather
the subtitles, and do topic analysis to extend the search capabilities to
similiar words and ideas.

## Tools used:

Jupyter notebook, BeautifulSoup4, Pandas,
[pysrt](https://github.com/byroot/pysrt), FFmpeg codec.
